## 🏗️ Data Engineering Interests
- Real-time vs batch data processing architectures(Looking at your data situation before making a decision on which path to take)
- Event-driven systems and streaming platforms
- Data reliability, schema evolution, and data quality
- Observability for data pipelines (metrics, latency, failures)
- Designing analytics-ready data models


---


## 📚 Currently Focusing On
- Designing scalable **data architectures**
- Advanced **Apache Kafka** patterns (partitioning, consumer groups)
- Improving **data modeling** for analytics and time-series workloads
- Building production-ready **Airflow DAGs**
- Cloud-native data pipelines on **AWS and Azure**
